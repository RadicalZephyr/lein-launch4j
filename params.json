It should end up\r\nlooking something like this:\r\n\r\n    {:user\r\n     {:plugins [[lein-launch4j \"0.1.0\"]]\r\n      :launch4j-install-dir \"/home/geoff/launch4j\"}}\r\n\r\nNow you need to create a [config.xml][l4j-docs] file for your project.\r\nPlace it somewhere in your project, I happen to like the `resources`\r\nfolder.  Then put `:launch4j-config-file \"relative-path/to/config.xml\"`\r\n\r\n[l4j-docs]: http://launch4j.sourceforge.net/docs.html\r\n\r\nNow you can package your app with launch4j just by running:\r\n\r\n    $ lein launch4j\r\n\r\n\r\nLeiningen 1.x is not currently supported.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nCopyright Â© 2013 Geoff Shannon\r\n\r\nDistributed under the Eclipse Public License, the same as Clojure.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
